                    People do not need a lot of equipment for cardiovascular exercise. Instead, they can take part in cardio training at home by working their own body weight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How to do them:
                    <ul >
                        <li type="circle">Beginner exercises do not require previous experience of physical activity or special training to perform. A person can usually increase the intensity as they advance in their cardiovascular ability.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Marching in place can elevate the heart rate, making this exercise a suitable choice for a warm-up or single cardio activity.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Dancing to upbeat music can burn calories, while people may find it very enjoyable as an exercise.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Rotate the arms in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. The movement may resemble a butterfly or backstroke.</li>
                        <li type="circle">A person should perform this exercise while lying down, which works the abdominal muscles, chest, and shoulders.</li>
                        <li type="circle">The trunk rotation works the abdominal muscles while testing the cardiovascular system.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Air squats work the thigh muscles, hamstrings, quadriceps, and glutes. Since good balance is required, they are an excellent way to engage the core muscles as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    Intermediate exercises increase the intensity of the workout to get the heart pumping and the body moving.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How to do them:
                    <ul >
                        <li type="circle">Jogging in place is a simple and effective exercise to increase heart rate. This is also a suitable beginner warm-up activity.</li>
                        <li type="circle">The air jump rope requires a person to “swing” an imaginary jump rope in the air. The exercise provides an alternative to jogging in place and is suitable as part of a warm-up routine.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Jumping jacks are a beginner cardiovascular exercise that a person can perform almost anywhere.</li>
                        <li type="circle">Squat to front kick exercise will challenge a person’s balance by adding a single leg kick at the peak of the squat position.</li>
                        <li type="circle">A person can incorporate stairs into a workout by going up and down them several times.</li>
                        <li type="circle">This shuffling motion closely resembles a football or speed-skating warm-up.</li>
                    </ul>
